# Maze-solver-using-different-algorithms
 You are expected to solve a 2-D maze using DFS, BFS, UCS and A* (using 2 different heuristics Euclidian and Manhattan). A maze is path typically from start node ‘S’ to Goal node ‘E’.
Input: 2D maze represented as a string and Edge Cost (in case of UCS and A*)
Output: 
Path: the path to go from Start to End (Bonus)
Full Path: the path of all visited nodes.
Total Cost (only in UCS and A*)
Maze: 'S,.,.,#,.,.,. .,#,.,.,.,#,. .,#,.,.,.,.,. .,.,#,#,.,.,.,#,.,#,E,.,#,.'
